## 07-Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler
...........................................................................................................

### Train Scheduler Overview

### About

ALL ABOARD!!  In this assignment, I've created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Objective
1. When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    a. Train Name
    b. Destination
    c. First Train Time -- in military time
    d. Frequency -- in minutes
3. Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
4. Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
